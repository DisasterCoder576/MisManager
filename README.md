# MisManager

This App allows you to send an automaed message to the caller when the user misses a call. If the caller replies back, the user will get a notification from the app.
It continuosly monitors the Phone state for incomming calls. If it is missed, then an SMS is sent to let the caller know the user was unable to pick the call.
It then monitors those missed numbers alone for any incomming messages and brings them as a notification.



*IMPORTANT: Find the codes in the "master" branch.*
